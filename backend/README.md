## Deployment

Sure, I can guide you through the process of deploying your Node.js Express app to Google Cloud. Here are the steps:

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project**: Sign in to your Google Cloud account. If you're new to Google Cloud, create an account to evaluate how the products perform in real-world scenarios‚Å¥.

2. **Enable Billing**: Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project‚Å¥.

3. **Install the Google Cloud CLI**: You can download it from the official Google Cloud SDK page¬π. After installation, initialize the gcloud CLI by running the command: `gcloud init`‚Å¥.

4. **Set the Default Project**: To set the default project for your Cloud Run service, run the command: `gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID`. Replace `PROJECT_ID` with the name of the project you created‚Å¥.

5. **Write the Sample Service**: Create a new directory named `helloworld` and change directory into it. Create a `package.json` file and an `index.js` file with the necessary contents‚Å¥.

6. **Deploy to Cloud Run from Source**: In your source code directory, deploy from source using the following command: `gcloud run deploy`. If prompted to enable the API, reply `y` to enable‚Å¥.

Please replace the placeholders with your actual project details. Also, make sure to check the official Google Cloud documentation for any updates or changes‚Å¥.
